# Smart Campus System

## Overview

The Smart Campus System is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance campus management and operations. This project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) following a Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model.

## Waterfall SDLC Steps

### 1. Requirements Gathering:

- Clearly define and document all the requirements for the Smart Campus System, including features, functionalities, and user expectations.

### 2. System Design:

- Create a detailed design document specifying the architecture, database schema, and user interfaces based on the gathered requirements.

### 3. Implementation:

- Begin development by setting up the backend using Node.js and Express.js.
- Code the server-side logic and integrate MongoDB for data storage.
- Proceed with frontend development using React, implementing user interfaces, and connecting them to the backend.

### 4. Testing:

- Conduct unit testing for individual components after each development phase.
- Perform integration testing to ensure components work together seamlessly.
- System testing to validate that the entire Smart Campus System meets specified requirements.

### 5. Deployment:

- Deploy the fully developed and tested system to a server or cloud platform.

### 6. Maintenance:

- Focus on system maintenance and bug fixing.
- Address any issues discovered during deployment or initial usage.

### 7. Documentation:

- Create comprehensive documentation at each stage of the Waterfall model, including requirements documentation, design documentation, and user manuals.

### 8. User Training:

- Train end-users and administrators on how to use and maintain the Smart Campus System.
